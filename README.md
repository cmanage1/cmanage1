## ✨ Welcome ✨

I'm a third-year Honours Computer Science and Psychology student @uOttawa. I develop applications in my free time and you can find the source code for all of them here. 
<br><br/>
While I'm away from my desk you find me either reading 📖,  enjoying the great outdoors 🌳 or cooking (kind-of) gourmet meals 🧑🏾‍🍳 
<br><br/>
📫 If you wish to reach me send me an email at: cmana072@uottawa.ca
